# Neighborhood Cat Watch

## Function of application:

- The application is designed to keep track of an
*arbitrary* amount of roaming cats in the user's 
neighborhood. 
- For each new cat the user finds roaming in the 
neighborhood, they must add it to the list of cats
for that neighborhood and log how many days it has
been fed for 7 days. 7 days is the minimum 
amount of days before it is assumed the cat has
no owner.
- The amount of times the user feeds it during the
7 days will determine whether they should either
send it to the shelter for adoption or send it to
the vet if it is not fed enough.
- Once this decision has been made, the cat will
be removed from the list.

## Targeted users and inspiration:
This is a very niche application, designed for cat
lovers on the lookout in their own neighborhood. 
This assumes that the user desires to feed the cats
as much as they can afford too, and that they have
a game plan for the cats' future. It is especially
designed for users who cannot take in the cats 
themselves. This would be an extremely beneficial 
application for me, as there are countless roaming 
cats in my current neighborhood. As with any cat 
lover, I want the best for these cats, and 
hopefully have them taken care of by others via 
adoption or a vet.
